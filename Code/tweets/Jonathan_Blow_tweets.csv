579850442139516928,2015-03-23 03:41:33,@grumpygiant That could be very tedious? And to enforce this on library writers you would have to supply no standard allocator..

579782886070468608,2015-03-22 23:13:06,@tylerglaiel and there is a back-pointer to the allocator there. If the blocks are big this would be little overhead.
579782813429276672,2015-03-22 23:12:49,@tylerglaiel Another potential solution is that allocators all conform to a spec wherein you can look at the top of any given memory block

579782429071708160,2015-03-22 23:11:17,"@tylerglaiel I am oversimplifying, you would either also pass the free function, or the allocator and free function are the same function."
